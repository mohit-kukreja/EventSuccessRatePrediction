# EventSuccessRatePrediction

The success of an event is an important outcome for both the organizing entity and the destination where the event is hosted to properly leverage its hosting. The purpose of this study was to examine factors that contribute to the success of a Technical event through the perspectives of the event providers and the participants who experience the events. 

Twitter generates a constant stream of communication, some of which concerns events of general interest. An analysis of Twitter may, therefore, give insights into how the population of that particular location would be inter- ested in attending the event. This project is a system for real-time analysis of public sentiment towards a particular technology and predicting a success rate of the event based on that technology. Also, recommending a better location to host the particular event to the event providers in order for the event to be more successful.
